# Optimization with Lagrange Multipliers

This repository contains a Python notebook that demonstrates how to find minima of a function subject to equality and inequality constraints using Lagrange multipliers and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.

## Features

- Symbolic computation using SymPy to define and solve optimization problems.
- Implementation of the KKT conditions to handle both equality and inequality constraints.
- Examples provided to illustrate the usage of the implemented function.

## How to Use

To use the `find_minima` function:
1. Define your `objective` function, `eq_constraint` for equality constraint, and `ineq_constraint` for inequality constraint.
2. Call the `find_minima` function with these parameters.
3. The function will return the valid solutions satisfying the KKT conditions.

## Requirements

- NumPy
- SymPy

## Example

The notebook includes two examples demonstrating the function's capability to find minima for different sets of constraints.

Feel free to explore the notebook and adapt the code for your optimization problems!
